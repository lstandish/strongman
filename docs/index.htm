<h2>Strongman Password Manager</h2>
<p>(these a temporary, concise description.  Detailed documentation will be published later.</p>
<p>Strongman Password Manager is an online password manager designed for extreme convenience and security.</p>
<h4>COMPUTED PASSWORDS</h4>
<p>In it's default mode, Strongman Password Manager <i>computes</i> passwords rather than store them.  This model avoids the need
to access a password database. Passwords are computed on your computer, using javascript. In fact, after
the page is loaded, there is no need for an Internet connection.<p>
<p>The computed password system depends upon the "strength" of the master password. (In fact, the same is true
for user-supplied, encrypted passwords - see below.) We strongly recommend the use of the "Diceware" system,
which consists of passphrases composed of several randomly-selected words. A diceware passphrase consisting of
7 words will be completely unbreakable for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>For your convenience in generating diceware passphrases, we recommend this <a href='https://www.rempe.us/diceware/#eff'>
Diceware passphrase generator.</a>  (If that link ever become unavailable, we are hosting the same password generator
<a href='/diceware'> here</a>). Note that this Diceware password generator uses an improved wordlist to generate
master passphrases that are easier to remember and type. <a href='https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/07/new-wordlists-random-passphrases'>more information</a>.</p>
<p>Passwords are computed by taking sha256 hashes of your master passphrase, a 4 digit PIN, the domain, and the username
for the domain, all concatenated together. 10000 rounds of sha256 hashes are calculated (to slow down brute force
hacking attempts), and the final hash is used to extract what is termed "entropy" in cryptographic
circles. Entropy is simply a way of referring to randomness or unpredictability.</p>
<p>This entrophy is used to build the computed password based on the selected character sets and password length.
In order to ensure that at least one character of the selected character sets is included, more entrophy
is extracted.  The resulting password is extremely secure.</p>
<p>One issue with using computed passwords is that you must provide not only the master password and domain
name, but also the username, character classes (characters from which to build the password), and
length. This extra information will vary from site to site.  In order to not have to remember them, Standish
Password Manager will normally save them for you on our server. Note that the master password is <i>never</i>
transmitted anywhere. The actual password computation takes place only on your computer.</p>
<p>By allowing domain, username, and options to be saved on our server, password computation becomes
extremely fast and easy. You need only enter your master password, then change to the "Domain" field
and start typing the domain name.  A popup list of your matching domains will appear, with usernames visible.
Upon selecting the domain/username combination, the password is computed and you are ready to click the
"copy" button to copy it to your clipboard.<p>
<h4>STORED PASSWORDS</h4>
<p>This "computed password" method, though ensuring security, has one inconvenience: you are essentially
obligated to use the computed password.  You will have to update your passwords at the sites you use.</p>
<p>But suppose you have some passwords that you don't want to update, or don't have time to update? Suppose
you already have very secure passwords that you have memorized, and want to keep in a password manager only in
case you forget one of them? Or suppose you use a site that insists on, for example, a certain <i>number</i>
of a character class (such as 2 uppercase letters, 2 lowercase letters, etc.) In that case, you may not be able to use
a computed password for that site</p>
<p>For all the situations where you prefer to use <i>your own</i> password rather than a computed one, Standish
Password Manager offers the option to store your password to the server, encrypted with AES256 ("military grade"
encryption). As with computed passwords, your master password never leaves your computer.  The AES256
encryption is done via javascript, on your computer, and only the <i>encrypted</i> password is transmitted
to our server.  <i>This method is just as secure as the "computed password" method.</i>
