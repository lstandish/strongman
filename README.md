Strongman is a **free open-source online password manager** written in javascript with a touch of php. It uses a master password combined with username and domain to create "computed" passwords (similar to [lesspass]).  It can also use AES-256 encryption to store "custom" passwords and "secure notes" on a web server. The emphasis is on **speed**, **security**, and **simplicity**.

You don't need to install Strongman in order to use it, since I host it for free public access [Open Strongman Password Manager]. The source code is available here for those who wish to self-host Strongman, for code auditing, and for collaborators.
