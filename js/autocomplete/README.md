Autocomplete for jQuery
=======================

Presentation
------------

Enables users to quickly find and select from different kinds of source (pre-populated list of values, ajax source (json, text), callback).  

Why using autocomplete ?
------------------------

1. Flexibility 

- Lot of options allow to customize the autocomplete process (autohide, prefix match, min length...)
- Ajax exchange can be populated throught callback to add / modify data to the post (get) and result can be redefined also throught callback.
- CSS is really short and fully modifiable

2. Cross browser
- Tested on Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera, IE
- Also manage max-width, max-height for IE

3. Lot of examples 
 - ajax: json, text ; callback ; cache 
 - lists : flat, array, callback
